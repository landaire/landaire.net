Updated: April 5, 2017 to address some incompleteness and errors. You can view the revision history here.\n\nApplication Services is a framework in iOS and OS X which provides what's known as the Image I/O framework. ImageIO itself is a collection of utilities and data types for parsing various image formats. It's used in many OS X and iOS applications including:\n\nTweetbot\nSafari\nMessages\nMail\nPreview\n\nSome popular applications that do not use ImageIO include:\n\nChrome\nFirefox\nTelegram\n\nGiven the impact of media processing bugs such as Stagefright I decided that this would be a good target for fuzzing. I created a simple application that uses some various features of ImageIO, grabbed a small PNG I had on my desktop which happened to be a screenshot, and let afl run.\nI checked on my fuzzer after 30 minutes and already a crash!\nHere's the code used: Gist (this is almost verbatim Apple's ImageIO sample).\nNote: a tl;dr is available at the bottom\nPNG Structure\nBefore I dive into the vulnerability I'll talk a little bit about the structure of PNG files. PNGs are comprised of the header and chunks with chunks starting at offset 0x8 in the file. Each chunk contains the chunk type (a 4-character ASCII string), some data, and a CRC32 of that data.\nThe chunk structure can be represented as the following Go struct:\n\nThe PNG specification defines 4 \"critical\" chunk types and 14 \"ancillary\" chunk types for a total of 18 formally defined types which you can find here. Any chunks not specified here are considered unknown chunks that can be handled by the decoder.\nThe vulnerability\nInspecting the crash log of the application makes it pretty obvious that we have a null pointer dereference:\n\nThe stack trace tells us a little more though:\n\nread_user_chunk_callback is where the crash occurs. A quick Google search for this and png_handle_unknown yields some results in libpng. Some more digging around the source code lead me to conclude that Apple uses libpng under the hood for the PNG files and the crashing image has an unknown (non-standard) chunk that's related to the crash. png_handle_unknown will, if PNG_READ_UNKNOWN_CHUNKS_SUPPORTED is enabled, call a user function callback for the application to handle the chunk. So read_user_chunk_callback is the name of Apple's custom chunk handler.\nA quick diff between the input file and crasher revealed that the input file had a chunk with data size of 0. What's happening here is:\n\nlibpng which is compiled to read unknow chunks hits an unknown chunk\nImageIO has an unknown chunk callback setup\nSince the size of the chunk data is 0, libpng gives the callback a null data chunk pointer\nThe data section is used without first checking the size of the value of the pointer\n\nEarlier I mentioned that the image I grabbed was some random screenshot I had sitting on my desktop. It turns out that screenshots taken on OS X include a custom iDOT chunk which contain some additional 28 bytes of data. The structure for the\nscreenshots I took were of form:\n\n(Yes, the width appears to be repeated 3 times)\nI couldn't figure out what the unknown data is and wasn't too motivated to reverse engineer the rest of the function so if anyone reading this has any ideas, please ping me on Twitter (@landaire).\nThis was the offending chunk which is handled by this callback. Taking any screenshot and setting the size of the iDOT chunk to 0 is enough to trigger the bug.\nImpact\nThis bug can be triggered any time a PNG file is being processed. So really, anything that processes the image can be caused to crash. Some examples:\n\nReceiving the malicious image via text message with message previews turned on will crash SpringBoard on iOS\nEntering a message thread containing the image will crash the messages app\nOpening an email containing the image will crash the mail client\nPosting a link to the image will crash some third-party Twitter clients which try to load the image (Tweetbot for example)\nVisiting a page containing the image will crash Safari's content renderer\n\nAffected versions\nThe only devices I had available at the time were an iPad on iOS 7.1, my iPhone on iOS 9.0.2, and my Mac on OS X 10.11.2. All of these devices were vulnerable. It's reasonable to assume that this bug goes back quite far.\niOSOS X\nMinimum tested version7.110.11.1\nFixed version9.3.210.11.5\n\nOther findings\nIn exploring this bug I thought it was useful to test out various applications to see how they would handle this type of invalid image. Since the chunks all contain a CRC32 of the data, you cannot modify the image outright and then upload it to\nalmost any service. Twitter and imgur were two hosts I tried and they both would not accept the image because of the invalid CRC32. I wrote a simple Go utility that iterates the chunks and fixes any\ninvalid CRCs.\nAfter fixing the chunk both hosts accepted the image just fine. imgur (and likely most other hosts) do not bother to strip unknown chunks so uploading the image to imgur puts those users at risk. Twitter and Facebook on the other hand will re-encode any image as\na JPEG which will obviously remove the malicious chunk.\nI think that this is interesting and really important for privacy-concerned people. Before investigating this bug I had not considered additional chunks not being stripped when uploading an image to services.

I responded to the post already on Twitter (sometimes known as X) and in hindsight should have just written a blog post to begin with since the platform is so terrible for longform comment.\nWhat follows is hopefully a more organized, digestable, and better response to John's post than what I wrote on Twitter. If you haven't read his post, I recommend giving it a read for full context instead of reading just what I've decided to directly respond to.\nJohn's post goes into some concerns about using Rust and if Rust is really the right choice over something GC'd, and covers a few angles including whether memory safety really matters for you, what language best fits your team, and something that came up multiple times is dependency usage.\nI disagree with some of the arguments John made surrounding dependencies and I frequently hear similar sentiments said by crowds who are anti-Rust. The idea that a program is less desirable or less secure because it has more dependencies. I find these arguments to be an easy jab lacking substance, and wanted to take an opportunity to challenge them.\nMy big complaint with John's points is that he spells out negatives but ignores most positives, instead telling the reader to figure those out for themselves.\nIt's important to understand who I am for a frame of reference: my background is in security and I first learned to program in C# making tools for Xbox 360 modding. That involved some reverse engineering and learning C++ for writing trainers/tools/cheats or whatever stuff would have to run on the console. Following my Xbox hacking in my teens, I professionally did web dev for some years (PHP), then web security, then hypervisor security at Microsoft, and now native code security focused on mobile applications. With the exception of my ~3 years in professional web dev, my title has always had \"Security Engineer\" in it -- not \"Software Engineer\". I sure as shit write a lot of code though.\nI was entirely self-taught in programming at age 13 mostly through following online tutorials, and got a bachelor's degree in computer science.\nMy language of choice for about 8 years now has been Rust. This was settled upon after trying Go, D, Python, and some other languages inbetween. I am nobody in C/C++ circles and I'm a nobody in Rust circles, but I do pay close attention to the Rust community because I love the language.\nWhy are dependencies seen as insecure?\nJohn talks about this at good length and it's worth reading his thoughts. If you're too lazy to do so, I think it can be sufficiently summarized as:\n\n\"Code review is a lot harder to do well than writing code\"\nDependencies can come from anyone and can generally be contributed to by anyone. Therefore the more dependencies you have, the larger your implicit circle of trust, and any break in that circle breaks your security. They become a single point of failure.\nYou trust the code you write, and you know the code you write.\n\nOn #1, I don't agree -- at least not broadly. It's probably true for small bits of code that you have the technical know-how to write yourself, but in memory-safe langauges what's the worst thing you can miss in a code review of something that's not technically complicated? Probably minor bugs that would cause a DoS. So you bring in a dependency that you didn't audit super closely and now you have a DoS in your application. Depends on your threat model how important this is to you, and whether that impacts your mental quality rating of the dependency.\nOn #2 I mostly agree. You are opening up your circle of trust, but done right you can protect yourself. The npm left-pad incident is a prime example of what can go wrong from even a non-malicious dependency failure.\nIn the left-pad incident a package named \"left-pad\" was removed from the npm registry causing widespread build failures for almost every node.js application. The broad usage of this dependency shocked people since it was less than 50 lines of code and could be written by anyone.\nIf you're pulling in a dependency that's already compromised then you're a bit late, but for avoiding future compromise you can:\n\nUse a package service that does not delete yanked dependencies. This should only be possible in extremely rare scenarios where e.g. someone's private information was exposed. crates.io, Rust's default package source, does not permit deletion.\nCommit lockfiles to ensure that builds are reproducible, the same dependencies are pulled every time, and a future compromise of a dependency doesn't impact you unless you explicitly update. This is the default behavior for Cargo and npm. The lockfile will also ensure that the dependency's location is preserved, preventing dependency substitution attacks and should ensure that with the first point above that even a yanked dependency can still be resolved.\nVendor dependencies so that you have a true complete snapshot of things without relying on 3rd parties. This weighs a lot more and is harder to manage over time but is an immediate solution to both of the above points.\n\nOn #3, sure. This is reasonable, but there are costs to writing that code that I'll cover later on.\nJust because C/C++ users suffer doesn't mean everyone else has to\nI'm going to quote a few of John's paragraphs for full context and then dissect some of them one-by-one:\n\nRust makes it easy to pull in outside dependencies, and much like in the JavaScript ecosystem, it seems to have encouraged lots of tiny dependencies. That makes it a lot harder to monitor and manage the problem.\nBut Rust’s situation is even worse than in most languages, in that core Rust libraries (major libraries officially maintained by the Rust project) make heavy use of third party dependencies. The project needs to take ownership and provide oversight for their libraries.\nTo me, this has long been one of the biggest risks in software. I can write C code that is reasonably defensive, but I have a hard time trusting any single dependency I use, never mind scaling that out.\nProperly securing your dependency supply chain is a much harder problem than writing safe C code. Personally, I only pull in dependencies beyond standard libraries if the work I’d have to do in order to credibly replace the functionality is so great that, if I didn’t bring in a dependency, I would choose not to do the work.\nC is a lot better than Rust in this regard, but it’s not particularly great. Partially, that’s because the C standard libraries (which I am always willing to use; the core language implementation and runtime is a given) are not at all extensive. People who write a lot of C end up building things themselves once and keeping them around and adapting them for decades, including basic data structures like hash tables.\n\nFirst of all, I strongly disagree with the sentiment that securing your dependency supply chain is harder than writing safe C/C++ code.\nYou have to be at least a moderately advanced user in C++/core memory safety ideas to come to the realization that modifying a container while iterating it with iterators is a bad idea, or that there are subtly different ways to zero-initialize a structure that result in subtly different ways of it being zero-initialized (which may or may not include its padding), or that some types of pointer arithmetic/comparisons are undefined behavior.\nYou don't need to be an advanced programmer to do a short sniff test to see if a dependency you're bringing in to your application looks fairly widely used and trusted by a community. Sure, the XZ backdoor is an extreme example of even experts who were members of the project missed something snuck in over time, but this is not what we're talking about here.\n\nRust makes it easy to pull in outside dependencies\n\nHonestly? Thank god.\nWhile C/C++ applications generally require fewer dependencies, most of the time you're relying on the project maintainer to provide you with a list of those dependencies and how to install them with your platform's preferred package manager.\nSomething that I always find myself saying when try to build a C/C++ application from source is \"shit I'm missing a header\" and general complaints about the build tools themselves. And of course the build/configuration tool tells you what you lack but doesn't tell you what you need to install because that's not its responsibility. The build tool may support building on your favorite OS, but it doesn't know how to install packages on that OS or even what the package is.\nSo you're left with a terrible error message that can leave you wondering \"Do I need to install lib-dev-whatever2 or just lib-whatever2? Is this even available via my OS's package manager?\"\nDon't forget all of the dependencies you need to install just to install the dependency too: pkgconf, autoconf, autotools, ninja, cmake, whatever, and any other libraries this single dependency may rely on. Kicking the problem into a Dockerfile is also not a good substitution for a quality build tool.\nThe developer experience surrounding dependencies in C/C++ is so awful that you just default to not using any at all. Or you bring in a \"header-only library\" that makes integration easy because bringing in multiple external source/header files makes people want to turn off their computer and consider another career.\n\n[Easy dependency usage] seems to have encouraged lots of tiny dependencies. That makes it a lot harder to monitor and manage the problem.\n\nI disagree that the dependency story becomes harder to manage. There are multiple tools to monitor and manage your dependency usage in Rust:\n\ncargo-tree can tell you your dependency tree\ncargo-geiger can tell you if any of your dependencies in the graph use unsafe{}\ncargo-acl can tell you which crates use unsafe{}, run build scripts to see if any use network/filesystem, and provides you with API usage information to see if a crate is doing things unexpected. It can even sandbox the build tools.\ncargo-audit can tell you if any of your crates are affected by a known security vulnerability and fix the used package version automatically.\n\nThese are all possible because Rust's tooling ecosystem is so good. These are not things that are run by default so the argument is a bit weaker, but the fact that they exist means you have the option of using them if you want to. For example, I've seen many CI pipelines that use cargo-audit to ensure vulnerable crates aren't being used.\n\nPeople who write a lot of C end up building things themselves once and keeping them around and adapting them for decades, including basic data structures like hash tables.\n\nI see this as a bad thing. You're probably going to write bugs and it's going to be hard to fix affected applications. No proper version tracking or update mechanism means that depending on how you use and manage this ad-hoc dependency, tracking where it's used and patching affected programs might be difficult.\nA hash table is also not necessarily a \"basic\" data structure but I would definitely consider it a common data structure. Common data structures and algorithms can still have bugs, and there are many examples of this (and if it's so common why isn't it in the stdlib?). No intent here to shame these folks, but just some examples: smallvec, libwebp's Huffman tree decoding, and glibc's qsort(). (I'm aware that glibc and libwebp would typically be installed using your distro's package manager but that's besides the point.)\nSo why are we shooting ourselves in the foot by making it difficult to track and manage our dependencies for C/C++, including even our own first-party dependencies?\n@Lucretiel summarized this same sentiment fairly well on Twitter:\n\nQuick reminder that I C doesn't have a culture of minimal dependencies because of some kind of ingrained strong principles in its community, C has a culture of minimal dependencies because adding a dependency in C is a pain in the fucking ass.\nRust and Node.js have smaller projects and deeper dependency trees than C++ or Python for literally no other reason than the fact that the former languages make it very easy to create, publish, distribute, and declare dependencies.\nThis is systemic incentives 101.\n\nRust isn't as \"batteries included\" as other languages\nOne point John makes is:\n\nLanguages like Go and Python that have extensive standard libraries that the language maintainers take responsibility for are actually the best case scenario in my opinion. Yes, more people touch the code, but the DIY economics are often the wrong choice, and having organizations willing to both be accountable, and provide an environment where people can focus on minimizing dependencies if they feel its important, is a good thing.\n...\nGenerally, I think Rust (and pretty much any programming language) would be served well to take ownership of their standard libraries. Pull in all the dependencies, and be willing to take ownership.\n\nI agree with John that having batteries included simplifies things for both new and established users, but I don't think we should be so quick to add more batteries to the collection without sufficient testing.\nMy understanding is Rust has learned from the mistakes of other languages and explicitly tries not to include things in the standard library that the Rust core team believes don't quite fit, including for reasons of figuring out the API. You simply have more freedom with packages: they're semver-versioned and you can break compat with an appropriate version bump.\nYou don't necessarily know the warts of an API until you start to really use it widely. Take for example the rand crate. There is no random number generator in the Rust standard library, and rand is the de facto standard crate for this task.\nThat's a bit odd, no? Random number generation is fairly common and one would think it's in the standard library. There's even a tracking issue for adding one: #27703 (and #36999).\nWhile I agree in principle, putting something into the standard library mostly means that the APIs for it are immutable. You know what's changed in fairly minor but meaningful ways since those issues were closed? The rand crate's APIs. If these had been brought into the standard library as-is we'd be mostly forever stuck with certain warts like Rng::gen_range() accepting 2 args (low, high) instead of the more-natural Range (using low..=high syntax).\nRust itself is still a growing and changing language as well, and it may not make sense to land on an API that would be better once language improvements land. Good luck changing a stabilized API without breaking compat.\nPackage management in other languages also suck\n\nYes, Python has become so popular, that plenty of people use outside dependencies, and there are several popular package managers. However, it’s still in a vastly better place from a supply chain perspective than JavaScript, which has become famous among developers for hidden dependencies on trivially small packages.\n\nThere's no way to really sugarcoat this, but Python and Go package management really fucking sucked (Python still sucks, but some semi-recent tools are making it suck less).\nSo Python has monolithic dependencies... but why? Because the tooling and uploading dependencies is high-friction(I've never uploaded -- maybe it's easier than I think). And we're supposed to praise this? In what world is Python + pip \"in a vastly better place from a supply chain perspective than JavaScript\" because of this fact either?\n\npip dependencies are by default global which causes conflicts with other Python applications, forcing you to use virtual environments. Note: /u/encyclopedist on Reddit pointed out that this has recently changed with PEP 668.\nIf pip hits a version conflict within your own project's package graph you're in for a headache\nPackages with native dependencies are a mystery to basically everyone except the package author. Or is this just me?\nThere's no strong lockfile containing metadata sufficient for guaranteeing the bits someone installing a project's dependencies for the first time match the bits when the lockfile was generated (i.e. package hashes).\n\npip in my experience has been so frustrating to use for dependency management that it inspires me to just simply not use dependencies to begin with. Yes there are tools that make this easier, but they are not defaults or even agreed upon by the community.\nAnd before Go had its package management renaissance does anyone remember what it looked like to use dependencies in Go?\nYou imported a library like this in your code:\n\nYou use go get to download the dependencies to your local machine, and built the application.\nThere were no lock files, no versions, nothing. The latest version of the source code was grabbed and used until you updated it which may have had breaking changes. The community had to resort to package proxies to version packages. Today it's pretty insane to think about letting a 3rd party man-in-the-middle your packages and deliver it to you with no integrity checks just to work around warts in the tools.\nAnd what about other languages like C#? NuGet, .NET's package manager, was also terrible.\nI don't know how it is today, but around ~2017 while working at Microsoft I discovered that NuGet had a \"feature\" where the client would reach out to all of your package feeds in parallel to fetch a package and whichever responded first won. I can't find the issue for it on GitHub, but someone had reported this behavior and it was considered \"by-design\".\nEven still when I presented the problem to the NuGet team internally, they did not see it as a vulnerability. The obvious problem here was that we were leaking our internal package names to external package feeds and a name collision could result in the wrong package being used (this was before dependency substitution/confusion attacks were widely known).\nNuGet also had no lock files, no integrity checks, and conveniently provides install/build scripts and usually what you're receiving is prebuilt binaries. Code integrity isn't verified and the only thing that would have prevented you from using a completely different binary was Strong naming which is not a security boundary. In fact, I've seen a lot of projects publish their strong name key.\nRust was fortunately blessed from the beginning (pre-1.0, 2014!) with people who knew how to build a package manager. Cargo is not perfect, but it works pretty damn well for the majority of Rust users.\nIt is because the package management story in Rust is so good compared to other languages that the standard library doesn't need to be as feature-complete. Shipping with a fantastic package manager in 1.0 allowed the community package ecosystem to explode without having to pause and shift towards better or different solutions (NuGet's change to JSON-based projects, Go's shift away from go get using git-based imports to Go modules, and many different Python package managers like poetry, rye, pipenv).\nRust developers are not bleeding from using the tools they depend on and it's absurd to me that this is considered a weakness.\nWhat about dependency explosion?\nHere is an example of an application I'm working on that reads files in a custom filesystem specific to the Xbox 360 (known as XContent / STFS). There's crypto involved for signing the header and verifying file data and conceptually this single file contains many others similar to a tarball or zip file.\nIt's a CLI application with the following dependencies in its Cargo.toml file:\n\nAccording to cargo deps-list this results in 102 dependencies from the 10 direct dependencies I specified. cargo depgraph produced this graph:\n\nClick for a larger image\nThe sniff test\nI've mentioned my \"quick checks\" or \"sniff test\" a couple times in this blog post, so it's worth calling out what it is.\nI 100% did not audit all 102 of these dependencies in the above graph, but for each of the 10 I directly brought in to my application I looked at the author to see if I knew of them, looked at their project setup, and decided their goals align with mine which led me to using the crate. I've passed on crates that to me looked like someone not necessarily intending for others to use their work, or simply did not pass my vibe check.\nHere is what my personal flow looks like:\n\nDo a search for the topic I'm interested in\n\n\n\nCheck the crates.io page\n\n\n✅ The crate has good examples and information. I don't recognize the author, but that's not terribly uncommon.\n\nCheck the crate's stats to get an idea of how widely used it is\n\n\n✅ Tons of usage. These numbers can be gamed, but probably not to this level.\n\nCheck the versions.\n\n\n✅ 9 versions since its original release 8 years ago. The last release was 3 years ago. The author isn't changing stuff all the time which is good as I don't expect a hex crate to have heavy code churn.\n\nCheck who is using this crate to see if I recognize any of them\n\n\n✅ The hex crate has over 4,000 other crates depending on it and I recognize all of the top 5 biggest users.\n\nCheck the repo\n\n\n✅ This is not a great example but the hex crate has some stars, the active development about matches the crates.io page (keep in mind the repository doesn't have to match what's uploaded to crates.io!), and the project looks decently put together. There's also no build.rs script that I need to check out.\nThe crate passes all of my standard checks! I feel comfortable pulling the crate into my repository\nEconomic factors\nSomething John mentions multiple times is weighing \"economic factors\" when considering what language or dependencies to use.\n\nAvoid unnecessary dependencies. I will leave ‘unnecessary’ vaguely defined here; you need to be educated and judge all the economic factors. But note that, there are often other benefits to fewer dependencies, from shorter build times to less surface to test, to less risk from API changes or bugs from downstream dependencies.\n\nAre all of these 10 crates I used above strictly necessarily? No. I could get away with writing my own hex converter, human-readable size converter, command-line argument parser, drop mmap support, drop support for chrono date/time, and rewrite to use standard Result&lt;T, E&gt; instead of using anyhow. This is what such a Cargo.toml would look like:\n\nBut you know what I get from splurging on 6 extra deps?\nI can just write my fucking code. That's the biggest economic factor I care about.\nI don't have to worry about making my argument parser print out help and keeping its flags and info up-to-date and manually pretty. I don't have to leave the user with a shitty DateTime field because I can't write a good one for them since my app doesn't revolve around dates. I don't have to write boilerplate for bubbling up errors. The overall quality of the application and my dev experience is improved.\nhex and humansize are arguably my application's left-pad. Converting to/from hex is not terribly complex and converting a number of bytes to the best unit of KB/MB/GB is extremely easy. In fact, I'm pretty sure I originally wrote it for this project and then removed it. These dependencies do one task that's simple enough for me to write but I didn't.\nWhy? Because each handles some edge cases that may matter for me, and I'm not wanting to spend 30m of my time writing something that's not core to my application when someone already wrote the code and did it better than I would in those 30m. Instead I took 3 minutes to search around to find the crate, ensure it fit my needs and to sanity check it looked kinda legit, and then used it in my application.\nI got. Shit. Done.\nI will say that there have been times where I've compiled something and thought, \"Holy shit 500+ dependencies?\" But to me this isn't a signal of it's security but rather bloat and complexity. I have to think about everything the application does, its complexity, and consider if it's just bloated for no reason or if there is good reason for having so many dependencies. This can impact my judgement on the application's quality and how likely I am to use really use the tool.\n@Lucretiel said something else recently on Twitter said something that loosely fits into this topic:\n\nIt’s a good thing we’re keeping our dependency count low, I think to myself, as I read about how my UI framework also provides threads, networking utilities, data structures, floating point math, D-Bus, cryptographic utilities, geographic utilities, and a Bluetooth implementation\n\nBloat is everywhere. You just need to know how to look for it.\nCircle of trust\n\nAnyway, the more dependencies you have, the larger your circle of implicit trust is, the larger your attack surface is, and the more supply chain risk you’re taking.\n\nI'd rather assume an author of a crate that looks like it provides what I need has non-malicious intent than the other way around. Maybe that perspective will change if I ever get burned and my laptop gets ransomwared because I missed a build.rs file or a proc macro that does sketchy things.\nBut consider for a second: do you consider your OS as part of your circle of trust? It's unlikely you'll ever get backdoored by your OS, but bugs are certainly present and depending on your threat model a vulnerable OS means a problem for you.\nDo you know how much attack surface there is with say image parsing on iOS/macOS?\nYou can choose to not bring in libjpeg/libpng/libwebp and just use ImageIO (which is used by UIKit/CoreGraphics). Easy! Except you now have at least 30 different image formats on your attack surface that you didn't know about. And there's no way to turn them off. And now you're stuck ensuring that the image you're parsing is a trusted image format.\nYou might be screaming, \"But Apple is trusted! And Apple publishes updates!\"\nOk? Did you validate how many of those updates are backported to major iOS versions used by your users? Did you audit Apple's closed-source lib and discover this attack surface and then weigh the economic costs of not using it? I mean, ImageIO is mostly just a wrapper around libjpeg and libpng, so why not just use them directly?\nLikely answer: Because it's convenient and you might not care about the problems I am describing because you aren't some security nerd.\nClosing thoughts\nI would like to thank John for sharing his thoughts and perspective. I do outright agree with some his points:\n\nAvoiding unnecessary dependencies may be better long-term for better compile times and less potential problems down the road. This is a tradeoff worth considering, but to me is a minor point.\nThe bigger your dependency graph, the bigger your single-points of failure. I see this as a tradeoff for rapid development.\nUnderstand what makes sense for your team and your own threat model.\n\nBut I disagree with some of the foundational arguments like:\n\nC’s advantage in terms of lack of dependencies (which can come with a lower attack surface in general) is large, but still doesn’t make it the right economic choice in the first place. It might still be wiser to choose Rust when all economic factors are considered, but the security argument is just not one I find compelling enough.\n\nThe security risk of dependency use is simply not one I find compelling enough to select C over Rust, and certainly is not scarier than a buffer overflow. C lacking first-class support for dependencies should be considered a strong disadvantage since you can't even get good support for 1st-party dependencies.\nThe benefits Rust provides as a language are already enough for a lot of people to select it over C -- myself included. A stellar default package manager and build tool makes it all the better to use. In my opinion  \"dependency usage\" should be a minor footnote (and John explicitly says to weigh these kinds of factors yourself).\nAdditionally, I'd argue that a critical mem safety issue is statistically way more likely to happen and can have critical impact even with modern mitigations. Some of the memory safety bugs that we're finding are old enough to drink in the US, showing that they can be very difficult to find.

It's extremely straightforward to use on most platforms -- all you need to do is pass -fsanitize=address to clang/gcc and run the application.\nAs your application runs it builds metadata about its memory state into what's called a shadow memory. The shadow memory is essentiallly a compressed representation of the application's address space and is used to look up memory ranges that are considered addressable. Memory ranges that are not addressable will be referred to as \"poisoned memory\".\nWhen ASAN detects a memory safety issue it will print a report to the console and stop the application. The first bit of the report is as follows:\n\nIt tells us there's a container-overflow, what address the container overflow occurred at, the call stack of where the overflow occurred, and finally where the memory we're faulting on was originally allocated.\nThe next bit of the report is the shadow memory that was mentioned above:\n\n\nThe big arrow here is pointing into the shadow memory at [06], which according to the legend at the bottom of the screenshot tells us there are six addressable bytes followed by a global redzone (represented by the red 0xf9 in the shadow bytes).\nRuntime Instrumentation\nASAN builds its shadow memory at runtime with the help of its runtime library, libclang_rt.asan_{target_platform}_dynamic.dylib. The runtime library provides some of the following:\n\nMemory management hooks for malloc(), free(), operator new(), etc. Whenever a memory allocation/free occurs ASAN will update its shadow memory\nFunctions for checking if memory is addressable or poisoned.\nHooks for some common memory manipulation functions (strncpy, strcpy, memcpy, memcmp, etc.).\n\nFor checking if memory is addressable, ASAN's runtime provides some simple APIs that are used by its compiler instrumentation such as:\n\n__asan_load1\n__asan_store1\n__asan_load2\n__asan_store2\n__asan_load8\n__asan_store8\n...\n__asan_loadN\n\nNote: This is certainly not a definitive list of APIs, but are relatively common.\nThese all essentially do the same thing under the hood:\n\nThey take an address and size, check if memory in that range is poisoned, and reports a generic error if it is.\nCompiler Instrumentation\nThe compiler instrumentation is primarily used for poisoning stack memory and inserting calls into the runtime library for \"interesting\" loads/stores. Of course, not every load/store will be instrumented by ASAN as that'd be a bit too heavy weight and a lot of things can be determined to be \"safe\" statically in the compiler.\nI'm not a compiler expert and truthfully don't care to dive into the source code at this time to figure out how ASAN determines what an \"interesting\" load/store is. With that said, when one is encountered ASAN's compiler pass will insert calls to the __asan_{load,store}{size} runtime functions to check the operation.\nYou're Probably Missing Out-of-Bounds Accesses\nWith the crash course on ASAN out of the way, we can dive in to the main point of this blog post: you're probably missing OOBR/W in your applications if you're using C++/Rust/whatever language containers.\nThe Problem With Vectors\nHere is some example code that should raise an out-of-bounds access violation:\n\nWe have a vector with 5 bytes that we then try to copy 8 bytes from. Pretty standard out-of-bounds read. When we run this with ASAN however...\n\nhttps://godbolt.org/z/cecf6Pjz8\nNo crash! You might notice something interesting in the last line of the output though: the size of the vector is 5, but its capacity is 8.\nSome readers probably know that when you push_back() or insert data into a vector that's at its capacity, it reallocates the buffer to be double its current size, copies the data to the new buffer, and frees the old one (or just does a realloc()). As a vector starts to grow from 0 elements up to N, its growth looks like the following:\n\nSource\nThis is very problematic for us. We're not catching an out-of-bounds access because of some implementation detail. All ASAN knows is that the application requested a buffer with 8 bytes -- it doesn't know that in our case 3 of those bytes are unused memory that aren't safe for us to use yet.\nIn the general case, any memory accesses in the range from [vector.data() + vector.size(), vector.data() + vector.capacity()] won't be detected as an out-of-bounds access!\nThe Problem With Strings\nHere's an example that's basically the same as the vector example above -- except, we're now constructing an std::string with a static C string.\n\nAgain, this doesn't trigger a crash:\n\nhttps://godbolt.org/z/hdjK1WoKo\nSo the four-character string actually has a total capacity of 15, i.e. the std::string has over-allocated memory. If you tried initializing an std::vector with an explicit initializer list it would allocate only the exact number of elements needed... why are strings different?\nLet's take a look at LLVM's libc++ string code (simplified version will follow):\n\nGitHub link.\nYuck. This is not simple to understand, but we can see that there's some interesting inline buffer stuff going on with the __short struct at least. I've rewritten this code to be definitely not the same layout as an std::string but shows what's going on easier to understand:\n\nstd::string has an optimization for short strings that allows it to avoid a heap allocation. Unfortunately, this means that for small strings we won't detect small out-of-bounds reads (OOBR) similar to the std::vector problem. And similar to the std::vector problem, heap-allocated strings grow in a way that over-allocates memory to reduce the number of allocations every time you push more data to it.\nFixes\nThe \"One Weird Trick\"\nThis isn't really documented anywhere, but std::vector actually does have ASAN enlightenment to detect this exact problem we're talking about:\n\nGitHub Link.\nWhen the _LIBCPP_HAS_NO_ASAN preprocessor macro is not defined it has some logic for informing ASAN about the contiguous region of a vector as well as the contiguous region that's allocated but yet-unused. The preprocessor macro is only defined when:\n\nGitHub Link.\nSo why the hell aren't we getting this enlightenment? We never defined it ourselves.\nI don't even remember why I tried this, but it seems you need to explicitly pass -stdlib=libc++ and just like magic, it works. Our example for an std::vector will now detect the small OOBR with this flag:\n\nhttps://godbolt.org/z/ao64GcT7f.\nThere are some downsides to this:\n\nstd::vector is the only container with this enlightenment. But it does automatically update the poisoned region whenever we insert, remove, or clear the elements which is very nice.\nOur std::string example still doesn't detect the OOBR with this compiler flag: https://godbolt.org/z/3bj6nnGxG.\nYou may not want to enable this if you have modules you cannot compile with this flag that may share an std::vector. The module that's not enlightened would not poison memory correctly, leading to false-positives. There may be ABI compatability issues as well.\n\nCode-Level Fix\nGoogle's ASAN wiki provides documentation for how to manually poison memory yourself using ASAN_POISON_MEMORY_REGION(addr, size) and ASAN_UNPOISON_MEMORY_REGION(addr, size). We can use this as follows:\n\nOr if for some reason you don't want to pull in the ASAN interface you could just copy data to a vector with the appropriate pre-allocated size:\n\nCopying data sucks, but do what works for you. Note: avoid using std::vector::shrink_to_fit(). Per cppreference, \"It depends on the implementation whether the request is fulfilled.\"\nOther Tricks\nWhile I have your attention I wanted to call out some other things you can do to improve your ability to find bugs.\nFailfast\nIf you have an abstraction that's intended to safely handle memory, why wait for your test or fuzzing harness to find the bug? For example, in my opinion a span implementation should never be given an invalid memory range. We can enforce this at its constructor by checking if the provided memory region is poisoned and trigger a controlled crash:\n\nSanitizer Recovery\nWhenever you repro a bug with ASAN, try to remember to compile with -fsanitize-recover=address. This will essentially allow the application to recover and continue running when ASAN triggers a violation.\nIt may seem like a strange choice, but let's say you have a small out-of-bounds read that looks relatively boring. That bug may be hiding something much juicier that's triggered only when the OOBR occurs! -fsanitize-recover=address will allow the application to run until either a hard fault occurs or the application exits, but will still print any ASAN violation that occurs along the way.\nClosing Thoughts\nASAN is a very powerful tool, but has limitations on what it can provide you by default. When using abstractions that allocate memory for you, keep in mind that they may reduce ASAN's effectiveness. The examples shown here were exclusively C++ examples, but can be easily applied to other languages as well.\nRust, for example, has zero ASAN englightenment at the time of this blog post. That means unsafe { } code manually reading from a Vec&lt;T&gt;'s data pointer or passing the pointer across an FFI boundary may run into similar false-negatives. Ditto for the String type, OSString, etc.\n","id":"https://landaire.net/one-weird-asan-trick/","title":"One Weird Trick to Improve Bug Finding With ASAN"},"https://landaire.net/phpbb-3-1-7-security-update/":{"body":"The phpBB team released phpBB version 3.1.7-PL1\non Jan 11, 2016 which fixed a CSRF issue I found in the admin control panel BBCode\ncreation form. Since BBCode is basically whitelisted HTML created by admins this\nCSRF vulnerability could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript\ninto forum posts.\nThis was my first time looking at phpBB and I was very happy with actually being\nable to find something with significant impact within a few hours.\nFinding a target\nA good starting point for understanding the features and flow of phpBB controllers\nwould be to look at something users would have access to with complex operations\ngoing on. ./phpbb/phpBB/posting.php is a decent starting point since this is the page\nusers hit when creating topics/posts. This controller should have permission checks,\nrecord creation, form submission, and maybe some HTML escaping. At the top of\nthe file we can see something interesting:\n\nMostly all of the request variables used in this controller are defined a the top\nof the file, some of which are taken from this weird request_var() function\nwhich IntelliJ tells me is deprecated. This function is basically a wrapper for\n\\phpbb\\request\\request_interface::variable(). Looking at \\phpbb\\request\\request::variable()\nit can be seen that this method returns the  requested var from some associative array.\nThe array is the concatenation of the $_POST and $_GET global variables. For those of you\nnot familiar with PHP these are globals which contain the POST request\nand query vars (respectively). All of these variables are also trim()'d and\ntype casted to match the type of whatever the default value is.\nThis is a key bit of information: if we can find some place in a form where a\nPOST request is made we should also be able to make the request with a GET. Maybe\nwe should start looking for CSRF bugs?\nHow CSRF tokens work in phpBB\nDoing a simple find in file for \"form\" in IDEA I came across this line:\n\nLooking into the check_form_key() function it's clear that this is the function\nto check the CSRF token (using === mind you)... but it's done manually. And\nfurther down the file:\n\nSo adding and checking the CSRF token is done manually. This smells like something\nthat can lead to errors!\nFinding CSRF bugs!\nLet's search the project for add_form_key() and check_form_key().

We should be able to create BBCode over GET with a CSRF token omitted!\nHere's a demonstration of this vulnerability:\n{{&lt; youtube 7NsUoE32cyQ &gt;}}\nNotes\nAlthough this vulnerability can lead to XSS, it's really not practical. By default\nphpBB enforces re-authentication when admins go to the ACP and gives the admin\na different admin CP session ID.

I got curious how easy it'd be to hack my Yaesu FT-70D, so I started doing some research. The only existing resource I could find for Yaesu radios was someone who posted about custom firmware for their Yaesu FT1DR.\nThe Reddit poster mentioned that if you go through the firmware update process via USB, the radio exposes its Renesas H8SX microcontroller and can have its flash modified using the Renesas SDK. This was a great start and looked promising, but the SDK wasn't trivial to configure and I wasn't sure if it could even dump the firmware... so I didn't use it for very long.\nOther Avenues\nYaesu provides a Windows application on their website that can be used to update a radio's firmware over USB:\n\n\nThe zip contains the following files:\n\nI'm going to assume that the file specific to the FT-70D, \"FT-70D_ver111(USA).exe\", will likely contain our firmware image. A PE file (.exe) can contain binary resources in the .rsrc section -- let's see what this file contains using XPEViewer:\n\n\nResources fit into one of many different resource types, but a firmware image would likely be put into a custom type. What's this last entry, \"23\"? Expanding that node we have a couple of interesting items:\n\n\nRES_START_DIALOG is a custom string the updater shows when preparing an update, so we're in the right area!\n\n\nRES_UPDATE_INFO looks like just binary data -- perhaps this is our firmware image? Unfortunately looking at the \"Strings\" tab in XPEViewer or running the strings utility over this data doesn't yield anything legible. The firmware image is likely encrypted.\nReverse Engineering the Binary\nLet's load the update utility into our disassembler of choice to figure out how the data is encrypted. I'll be using IDA Pro, but Ghidra (free!), radare2 (free!), or Binary Ninja are all great alternatives. Where possible in this article I'll try to show my rewritten code in C since it'll be a closer match to the decompiler and machine code output.\nA good starting point is the the string we saw above, RES_UPDATE_INFO. Windows applications load resources by calling one of the FindResource* APIs. FindResourceA has the following parameters:\n\nHMODULE, a handle to the module to look for the resource in.\nlpName, the resource name.\nlpType, the resource type.\n\nIn our disassembler we can find references to the RES_UPDATE_INFO string and look for calls to FindResourceA with this string as an argument in the lpName position.\n\n\nWe find a match in a function which happens to find/load all of these custom resources under type 23.\n\n\nWe know where the data is loaded by the application, so now we need to see how it's used. Doing static analysis from this point may be more work than it's worth if the data isn't operated on immediately. To speed things up I'm going to use a debugger's assistance. I used WinDbg's Time Travel Debugging to record an execution trace of the updater while it updates my radio. TTD is an invaluable tool and I'd highly recommend using it when possible. rr is an alternative for non-Windows platforms.\nThe decompiler output shows this function copies the RES_UPDATE_INFO resource to a dynamically allocated buffer. The qmemcpy() is inlined and represented by a rep movsd instruction in the disassembly, so we need to break at this instruction and examine the edi register's (destination address) value. I set a breakpoint by typing bp 0x406968 in the command window, allow the application to continue running, and when it breaks we can see the edi register value is 0x2be5020. We can now set a memory access breakpoint at this address using ba r4 0x2be5020 to break whenever this data is read.\nOur breakpoint is hit at 0x4047DC -- back to the disassembler. In IDA you can press G and enter this address to jump to it. We're finally at what looks like the data processing function:\n\n\nWe broke when dereferencing v2 and IDA has automatically named the variable it's being assigned to as Time. The Time variable is passed to another function which formats it as a string with %Y%m%d%H%M%S. Let's clean up the variables to reflect what we know:\n\nThe timestamp string is passed to sub_4082c0 on line 20 and the remainder of the update image is passed to sub_408350 on line 21. I'm going to focus on sub_408350 since I only care about the firmware data right now and based on how this function is called I'd wager its signature is something like:\n\nLet's see what it does:\n\nI think we've found our function that starts decrypting the firmware! To confirm, we want to see what the output parameter's data looks like before and after this function is called. I set a breakpoint in the debugger at the address where it's called (bp 0x404842) and put the value of the edi register (0x2d7507c) in WinDbg's memory window.\nHere's the data before:\n\n\nAfter stepping over the function call:\n\n\nWe can dump this data to a file using the following command:\n\n010 Editor has a built-in strings utility (Search &gt; Find Strings...) and if we scroll down a bit in the results, we have real strings that appear in my radio!\n\n\nAt this point if we were just interested in getting the plaintext firmware we could stop messing with the binary and load the firmware into IDA Pro... but I want to know how this encryption works.\nEncryption Details\nJust to recap from the last section:\n\nWe've identified our data processing routine (let's call this function decrypt_update_info).\nWe know that the first 4 bytes of the update data are a Unix timestamp that's formatted as a string and used for an unknown purpose.\nWe know which function begins decrypting our firmware image.\n\nData Decryption\nLet's look at the firmware image decryption routine with some renamed variables:\n\nAt a high level this routine:\n\nAllocates a 64-byte scratch buffer\nChecks if there's any data to process. If not, set the output variable out_data_processed to the number of bytes processed and return 0x0 (STATUS_SUCCESS)\nLoop over the input data in 8-byte chunks and inflate each byte to its bit representation.\nAfter the 8-byte chunk is inflated, call sub_407980 with the scratch buffer and 0 as arguments.\nLoop over the scratch buffer and reassemble 8 sequential bits as 1 byte, then set the byte at the appropriate index in the output buffer.\n\nLots going on here, but let's take a look at step #3. If we take the bytes 0xAA and 0x77 which have bit representations of 0b1010_1010 and 0b0111_1111 respectively and inflate them to a 16-byte array using the algorithm above, we end up with:\n\nThis routine does this process over 8 bytes at a time and completely fills the 64-byte scratch buffer with 1s and 0s just like the table above.\nNow let's look at step #4 and see what's going on in sub_407980:\n\nOof. This is substantially more complicated but looks like the meat of the decryption algorithm. We'll refer to this function, sub_407980, as decrypt_data from here on out. We can see what may be an immediate roadblock: this function takes in a C++ this pointer (line 5) and performs bitwise operations on one of its members (line 18, 23, etc.). For now let's call this class member key and come back to it later.\nThis function is the perfect example of decompilers emitting less than ideal code as a result of compiler optimizations/code reordering. For me, TTD was essential for following how data flows through this function. It took a few hours of banging my head against IDA and WinDbg to understand, but this function can be broken up into 3 high-level phases:\n\nBuilding a 48-byte buffer containing our key material XOR'd with data from a static table.\n\n\n\nBuild a 32-byte buffer containing data from an 0x800-byte static table, with indexes into this table originating from indices built from the buffer in step #1. Combine this 32-byte buffer with the 48-byte buffer in step #1.\n\n\n\nIterate over the next 8 bytes of the output buffer. For each byte index of the output buffer, index into yet another static 32-byte buffer and use that as the index into the table from step #2. XOR this value with the value at the current index of the output buffer.\n\n\nThe inner loop in the else branch above I think is kind of nasty, so here it is reimplemented in Rust:\n\nKey Setup\nWe now need to figure out how our key is set up for usage in the decrypt_data function above. My approach here is to set a breakpoint at the first instruction to use the key data in decrypt_data, which happens to be xor bl, [ecx + esi + 4] at 0x4079d3. I know this is where we should break because in the decompiler output the left-hand side of the XOR operation, the key material, will be the second operand in the xor instruction. As a reminder, the decompiler shows the XOR as:\n\nThe breakpoint is hit and the address we're loading from is 0x19f5c4. We can now lean on TTD to help us figure out where this data was last written. Set a 1-byte memory write breakpoint at this address using ba w1 0x19f5c4 and press the Go Back button. If you've never used TTD before, this operates exactly as Go would except backwards in the program's trace. In this case it will execute backward until either a breakpoint is hit, interrupt is generated, or we reach the start of the program.\nOur memory write breakpoint gets triggered at 0x4078fb -- a function we haven't seen before. The callstack shows that it's called not terribly far from the decrypt_update_info routine!\n\nset_key (we are here -- function is originally called sub_407850)\nsub_4082c0\ndecrypt_update_info\n\nWhat's sub_4082c0?\n\n\nNot a lot to see here except the same function called 4 times, initially with the timestamp string as an argument in position 0, a 64-byte buffer, and bunch of function calls using the return value of the last as its input. The function our debugger just broke into takes only 1 argument, which is the 64-byte buffer used across all of these function calls. So what's going on in sub_407e80?\n\n\nThe bitwise operations that look supsiciously similar to the byte to bit inflation we saw above with the firmware data. After renaming things and performing some loop unrolling, things look like this:\n\nThe only mystery now is the set_key routine:\n\nThis function is a bit more straightforward to reimplement:\n\nPutting Everything Together\n\nUpdate data is read from resources\nThe first 4 bytes of the update data are a Unix timestamp\nThe timestamp is formatted as a string, has each byte inflated to its bit representation, and decrypted using some static key material as the key. This is repeated 4 times with the output of the previous run used as an input to the next.\nThe resulting data from step 3 is used as a key for decrypting data.\nThe remainder of the firmware update image is inflated to its bit representation 8 bytes at a time and uses the dynamic key and 3 other unique static lookup tables to transform the inflated input data.\nThe result from step 5 is deflated back into its byte representation.\n\nMy decryption utility which completely reimplements this magic in Rust can be found at https://github.com/landaire/porkchop.\nLoading the Firmware in IDA Pro\nIDA thankfully supports disassembling the Hitachi/Rensas H8SX architecture. If we load our firmware into IDA and select the \"Hitachi H8SX advanced\" processsor type, use the default options for the \"Disassembly memory organization\" dialog, then finally choose \"H8S/2215R\" in the \"Choose the device name\" dialog...:\n\n\nWe don't have shit. I'm not an embedded systems expert, but my friend suggested that the first few DWORDs look like they may belong to a vector table. If we right-click address 0 and select \"Double word 0x142A\", we can click on the new variable unk_142A to go to its location. Press C at this location to define it as Code, then press P to create a function at this address:\n\n\nWe can now reverse engineer our firmware :)\n","id":"https://landaire.net/reversing-yaesu-firmware-encryption/","title":"Reverse Engineering Yaesu FT-70D Firmware Encryption"},"https://landaire.net/world-of-warships-deobfuscation/":{"body":"An in-depth analysis of how World of Warships obfuscates its game scripts and how to mostly deobfuscate them. The wowsdeob project can be found on GitHub: https://github.com/landaire/wowsdeob\nBackground\nThis blog post is something I'm writing 3 years after my initial research/development, and about 2 years after I stopped actively working on the tool. Some of the details in this blog may not be fully accurate from time slippage and a lot of the initial research notes I made were lost or scattered in Discord conversations.\nI am only now writing this as the game is somewhat dead and the development team chooses to continually release content that makes gameplay worse. Submarines, hybrid battleships, aircraft carriers, and HE-spamming battleships with cruiser concealment that overmatch everything have led to a less enjoyable gameplay experience.\nThe tool and techniques have been kept to a very tight circle so that data mining could continue without a potential cat-and-mouse game with the developer. I apologize to that community if that does occur.\nTwo years ago I open-sourced a tool I called unfuck which I described as a \"Python 2.7 bytecode deobfuscator unfucker\". That tool was the result of the work I had done for World of Warships, but isn't capable of completely deobfuscating World of Warships files out-of-the-box. unfuck made the rounds on HN where I got supportive responses such as:\n\nLook, I get that edgy names are fun, but I'm happy that I will never have to use this tool for work, and I pity the fool who has to explain why \"unfuck\" was needed to solve a real problem.\n\nAnd:\n\nOoof, really bad name. Makes me think the project or maintainer are immature...\n\nAnd someone respecting my licensing choices:\n\nInteresting dual licensing\n\n\n\nThis project is dual-licensed under MIT and the ABSE (\"Anyone But Stefan Esser\") license. Note that an additional exception to the license is added, forbidding use/redistribution of said content to his trainees as well, but only when in a 5 mile radius from \"Stefan Esser\" or while holding any sort of (video)conference/chat with him.\n\n\nNote that this license will only be used as long as what would capstone decode / that one other arm64 ida plugin thing by i0n1c (\"Stefan Esser\") are not under the MIT license. afterwards, all exceptions are cleared and basically MIT license applies\n\n\nWhat is World of Warships?\nWorld of Warships (WoWs) is a free-to-play naval warfare multiplayer game released in 2015 by Wargaming and their Lesta Studio. It supports multiple forms of modifications via Adobe Flash for UI mods, XML/audio files for audio mods, custom ship textures, and Python for basically everything else. The Python APIs are somewhat limited, but can observe some in-game events that allow mod developers to surface information that the game doesn't show you by default.\nUnlike a lot of multiplayer games, WoWs uses an authoritative server model where each client is only receiving events that the server believes they should receive. For example, enemy ship locations and related information is only pushed down to clients when they are intended to be painted to your screen. There are no wall hacks and things like auto-aim are somewhat negated by player skill. That doesn't mean there aren't illegal mods/cheats that show you where to aim, where incoming artillery shells will land, etc.\nWith all of that said, there is very little incentive to cheat in this game. A top-tier player in World of Warships will have the game sense and skill that comes within a close margin to someone playing with cheats. Therefore deobfuscation of scripts doesn't necessarily help with cheat development apart from illegal mods, but may help modders create better mods in general.\nGame Scripts\nAlthough the World of Warships developers are mostly transparent about how game mechanics work, there have still been some mysteries. For example, the algorithm for how the dispersion ellipse of your shells is calculated and the dispersion of the shells themselves.\nThe format of match replay files is also mostly documented through reverse engineering work of a few researchers and from reviewing publicly available engine source code, but there are still unknown elements to the serialized format. For these reasons it's highly desirable to review the implementation code to unmask these mysteries.\nThere has been at least one other individual who managed to deobfuscate and decompile the game scripts as far back as 2016. A World of Warships EU forum member by the name of \"TehRick\" / \"ThiSpawn\" made multiple posts showing they had reverse engineered some of the C++ and Python logic. In fact, they explicitly called out the \"Lesta anti-noob protection\" obfuscated Python module name in one of their forum posts:\n\nIn a Reddit post by the same username they also linked to a decompiled Python source file: https://pastebin.com/y3Yk43Nd.\nAlthough TehRick seems to have disappeared soon after these posts, their code was still being referenced 4 years later!\nIf you are TehRick / ThiSpawn feel free to reach out to me -- I would love to talk about your deobfuscator!\nPython VM Primer\nWhen Python source code is executed, you may notice that a .pyc file is created. The Python interpreter doesn't interpret raw source code -- it first compiles that source code to an intermediate representation that can be fed to the VM as instructions.\nThe VM is stack-based with some \"registers\" which are used for runtime storage of variables in pre-defined variable (or unnamed) slots. Almost every VM operation with the exception of loads/stores will directly modify values on the stack in some way. Variable registers cannot be modified in-place, and must first be put directly on the stack.\nEach object on the stack or in a variable slot is a deserialized Python object representing one of the following types:\n\nNone\nStopIteration\nEllipsis\nBool\nLong\nFloat\nComplex\nBytes\nString\nTuple\nList\nDict\nSet\nFrozenSet\nCode\n\nBasically the raw primitive types you're probably used to when writing Python. All module definitions, functions, etc. are defined as Code objects that live in the co_consts section of their parent code object. Ditto with any lists, tuples, etc. that are hard coded in source code.\nInstructions\nWorld of Warships uses Python 2.7 which has helpful documentation covering all instructions here: https://docs.python.org/2/library/dis.html.\nAll instructions are at least 1 byte for the opcode and up to 3 bytes for instructions which have a 16-bit argument. For example, a JUMP_ABSOLUTE 300 may be encoded as 0x71_012c and a POP_TOP may be encoded as 0x01.\nThe WoWs developers did not do any opcode remapping, which is a fairly common obfuscation trick when an application has the flexibility of embedding the Python VM.\nPrior Work on Deobfuscation\nlpcvoid's Findings\nWorld of Warships' core game logic is contained within a scripts.zip file that is handled by a special loader. The loader reads compiled Python (files ending in .pyc) out of this zip archive and even uses a special technique of handling the serialized Python code object.\nThis logic and deobfuscating the first stage of the matryoshka doll has already been described by lpcvoid on his blog and he even has a part 2 going into some of the junk instructions. I highly recommend reading his blog posts before continuing, as I will not rehash his hard work.\nTo summarize his findings: the module loader deserializes the bytecode object and uses the bytecode as an encryption key for some ciphertext stored in const data. After decrypting the ciphertext, the plaintext is decompressed (zlib) and is executed as a code object.\nRapid Analysis of Bytecode Using pyasm\nI wanted to take a quick moment to call out that my friend @gabe_k wrote a tool for a CTF challenge he put together many years ago called pyasm that is specifically designed for this type of scenario. It can gracefully handle disassembling of bad instructions, and even supports recompiling a .pyasm file back to a serialized code object. I've forked the project and made some quality of life improvements/bug fixes here: https://github.com/landaire/pyasm.\nHere is an example of what one of these .pyc files look like when converted to a .pyasm file (redacted since it's very long):\n\nThroughout my analysis of the obfuscation tricks I frequently leaned on pyasm for manually reordering/deleting instructions in order to figure out which sections were causing hiccups for the decompiler.\nWoWs - Generic Obfuscation Tricks\n1: Bogus Instructions\nAfter decrypting and decompressing the 2nd stage code object, you'll find that tools like uncompyle6 fail to decompile the bytecode to source with an error. In his 2nd blog post lpcvoid covered one of Lesta's tricks of inserting bogus instructions that contain completely invalid opcodes which confuse these types of tools. One thing not mentioned is that these instructions can also be valid but really mess up the VM's stack and cause static analysis to enter a bad state.\nUnfortunately, tools like uncompyle are mostly intended to run on Python bytecode generated cleanly by a Python VM. Invalid opcodes are definitely not supported, and neither are invalid instruction operands. This trick is the most straightforward for causing a decompiler to choke.\n2: Stack Reordering\nDifferent Python code patterns -- even if semantically the same -- have very slight nuance in the emitted instructions. Tools like uncompyle in some cases rely on fragile instruction patterns for mapping to source code and will easily encounter errors when a wonky pattern is encountered.\nThe following is a completely made-up example, but consider the following instruction sequence:\n\nThis loads some code object from the const section, makes a function, and stores that function in co_varnames[6]. This would typically result in something like the following Python code:\n\nNow imagine that the instructions were rewritten to push and immediately pop a value to the stack randomly in the middle of creating the function:\n\nThe LOAD_CONST/MAKE_FUNCTION/STORE_FAST pattern is broken by instructions that are effectively a no-op, and the signatures used by the decompilers are now broken.\n3: Const Predicates\nRelated to trick #2, instruction patterns may be broken by inserting conditions that evaluate to a constant value. One side of the branch may bring you to some garbage instructions (trick #1) and on the other side of the branch will be the next set of valid code to be executed.\nConsider the following pseudocode:\n\nIn the middle of defining a function we've inserted a check to see if two sets overlap, and if so  we store the function in variable slot #6 (STORE_FAST 6). If the sets do not overlap, we go down the bogus code path that screws up stack state.\n4: Variable Renaming\nThis one really doesn't impact tools but definitely impacts any end user who manages to partially decompile anything: local variables and function names (in the serialized function object) are renamed to things that are illegal in Python source code such as keywords, operators, and a combination of these things with spaces. Function objects are typically renamed to be very large unique numbers. Here is a real example from when I first set on this project:\n\n5: Implicit Returns\nThe RETURN_VALUE instruction in Python returns the value located at the top of the VM's stack. Python will, as far as I'm aware, always emit a RETURN_VALUE with the immediately preceding instruction setting up the value to be returned. For example:\n\nThis loads the value stored at co_varnames[0] to the top of stack and returns it. Splitting up these instructions will break the pattern decompilers use to transform this into return varname. Imagine if the in the following code tos literally represented the top of the stack (and not a variable slot):\n\nThis would create the following control flow:\n\nIn this scenario the instruction immediately preceding the RETURN_VALUE isn't the instruction setting up the value -- it's likely some type of JUMP instruction or quite possibly anything else!\nIt's not clear to me if this is more of a code optimization trick, or an obfuscation trick, but really what's the difference?\n6: Weird Jumps\nSomething else I noticed was that some jumps were just... weird? There were randomish-looking JUMP_FORWARD N instructions that didn't make sense (but usually were just jumping over garbage instructions), and were hard to disambiguate from those legitimately generated by the Python compiler. For example, the following Python code may insert a JUMP_FORWARD 0 (jump to the next instruction):\n\nThis probably doesn't make much sense, so let me show a real example of the control flow at an instruction level:\n\n\nDo you notice the JUMP_FORWARD 0 in the left-center node? It's completely unnecessary! The layout of these instructions when serialized is: POP_TOP, POP_TOP, POP_TOP, JUMP_FORWARD 0, LOAD_FAST 2. The execution sequence of these instructions is exactly the same as well. You could remove the JUMP_FORWARD 0 and nothing of value would be lost. So why is it there?\nIt's just a side effect of how the Python compiler does codegen:\n\nSometimes that JUMP_FORWARD isn't jumping 0 bytes and may be some value that jumps over garbage instructions (and was inserted by the obfuscator). Other times this JUMP_FORWARD comes immediately after some other unconditional control flow instruction and will never be executed by a Python VM (or picked up by my instruction decoder).\nSo why can't it be removed if it's usually unnecessary? Unfortunately uncompyle relies on the presence of the JUMP_FORWARD to determine what type of condition has occurred.\n7: Generally Weird Control Flow\nThis one is hard to express without sounding psychotic, but let me just say: fuck loops, fuck exception handlers. If you combine the weird jumps and false predicates in loops, you may be able to generate some code that looks like a loop but is only ever executed for one iteration before just jumping to some other part of the code because of a const predicate.\nAnd what about exception handlers that intentionally raise an exception that's supposed to be caught to trigger the \"good\" code path?\nAnd what about nesting exceptions inside of loops with const predicates?\nAfter encountering such a scenario I was starting to feel like this:\n\nDeobfuscation\nDeobfuscating everything together requires a solid framework that can achieve:\n\nParsing all instructions in a manner that doesn't break on bogus opcodes\nEvaluating conditions to determine used/unused code\nRestoring instruction ordering\nRestoring variable names\nDeoptimizing code (implicit returns)\nNormalize weird control flow\n\n...so yeah the natural path I took here was to rebuild the Python VM in Rust in 2 months and write somewhat spaghetti code that revisiting two years later has me thinking \"wtf was I smoking?\".\nAvoiding Bad Instructions\nParsing instructions is fairly straightforward: an instruction with no arguments is 1 byte (opcode), and an instruction with an argument is 3 bytes (opcode + uint16). You start parsing instructions by reading from offset 0 in the co_code section of the code object and just continue this in a loop.\nDecompilers and disassemblers tend to read instructions linearly -- i.e. if the first instruction is JUMP_ABSOLUTE 200 it's going to disassemble JUMP_ABSOLUTE 200 from offset 0, then disassemble the next instruction from offset 3. This isn't great because you will run into a bunch of bogus instructions that can be avoided by simply creating a decoder that understands control flow.\nTo mitigate this in my deobfuscator I instead add instruction offsets to a queue. A JUMP_ABSOLUTE 200 will add offset 200 as next in the queue, and a JUMP_IF_{TRUE,FALSE} &lt;TARGET&gt; will add the offset for the target and the next instruction to the queue.\nAlong the way I also compile an instruction graph where each node represents a basic block with edges to other basic blocks:\nRemoving const predicates\nRemember how I said I rebuilt the Python VM in Rust? I was serious, and it was just to solve this problem. I do what I've called \"partial execution\". Certain builtin functions are handled, and an individual code object's opcodes are executed to obtain a snapshot of the VM's stack and perform taint tracking. The main function signature is:\n\nBrief rundown of all inputs:\n\ninstr: the instruction to be executed\ncode: the deserialized Python code object for which the instruction belongs to\nstack: current snapshot of the VM stack\nvars: all variable slots and their current values\nnames: map to a vars slot\nglobals: similar to vars but on a global level\nnames_loaded: modules imported\nfunction_callback: callback for CALL_FUNCTION instruction and can be used for handling builtins or calling other code objects if desired\naccess_tracking: data to associate with a VM stack value\n\nWhen an instruction is executed and the stack is modified, the modified stack value will represent a tuple of (Option&lt;value&gt;, [access_tracking]). The first value in the tuple is the value that resulted from executing an instruction if it could be determined, otherwise None. The second value will represent some metadata for looking up instructions which contributed to generating/modifying that stack value (a basic block index + instruction index).\nThe execution loop for a basic block looks something like this:\n\nThis will effectively remove instructions related to const conditions and (usually) the basic block not taken from the graph. These inserted, fake basic blocks are implicitly removed since they become orphaned from the main code graph.\nThere are some issues with this approach:\n\nI need to correctly implement almost all VM instructions\nLarge traces will balloon in computation complexity and memory\nComplex arithmetic or unsupported instructions will immediately stop the VM, which leaves code only partially deobfuscated\n\nRestoring Variable Names\nVariable names are unfortunately always lost. Instead of \"restoring\", I simply iterate and replace odd var names with the following script:\n\nPretty simple replacement of illegal-looking variable name with unknown_N.\nRestoring Function Names\nUnlike var names, function names generally can be restored due to an oversight in the obfuscator. When a function is defined in a module, the bytecode for setting it up looks like the following:\n\nNAME_INDEX corresponds to a name string value located in the co_names array in the code object. The code object for the function also contains its name, which is generally what's used by decompilers to label a function. I leveraged this in my instruction handler loop by checking:\n\nStrictly speaking these names aren't even necessary for the VM to run the code since they're really only present for debugging purposes. I suspect that this is either an oversight by Lesta or they deliberately left these in for debugging crashes on clients (although I'm not certain if they send back Python crash reports). Maybe there's something I don't know though.\nDeoptimizing Code\nI think that RETURN_VALUE is really the only case I had to correct, and it was a fairly simple fix.\n\nLook for basic blocks that contain only a RETURN_VALUE instruction\nFor each incoming edge, replace the final instruction in the basic block to be RETURN_VALUE\nRemove the basic block from step 1\n\nThe example control flow for return values then provided in the section about implicit returns will now look like this:\n\nFixing Bad Instructions\nThere are some scenarios where code paths containing bad instructions can't be outright removed. Usually it's because a condition couldn't be proven to be a const predicate, or there was some other factor involved that led to it not being removed. Even though I know they're bad, I'm hesitant to outright outright remove the nodes and conditions as gaps in the VM and data mixing may lead to incorrect instruction removal.\nTo correct these basic blocks I calculate the depth of the stack at the location of the bad instruction, insert enough POP_TOP instructions to clear out the stack, and finally put a LOAD_CONST None and RETURN_VALUE at the end of the basic block to force a return None.\nThe Rest of The Matryoshka Doll\nThere are four distinct \"stages\" to loading the Python module, two of which we've already loosely discussed from lpcvoid's blog (encrypted code, and the compressed code).\nStage 2 - Decompressed Code\nThe following is an example stage 3 payload:\n\nThere are some checks to ensure that certain state is set up, but in general this will:\n\nLoad the co_code from the original stage 1 file\nApply a substitution cipher over each byte\nDo some bit arithmetic on each byte of the result from step 2\nExecute the code that was just decoded\n\nIn my deobfuscator I was able to leverage the custom Python VM to apply the swapmap for me by creating a state machine. Essentially I scan for certain instructions that look like they're applying the swapmap, then execute that function with some fake VM stack set up. That code can be found here: https://github.com/landaire/wowsdeob/blob/ffeeedaea9390c1d1e9ba785360e75aaa1aa10d0/src/smallvm.rs\nStage 3\nThis stage is pretty boring all things considered. The Stage 3 code object is just another compressed code object that's been base64 encoded and had the result reversed.\n\nNo big tricks here. The deobfuscator logic can be found here: https://github.com/landaire/wowsdeob/blob/ffeeedaea9390c1d1e9ba785360e75aaa1aa10d0/src/main.rs#L290-L297.\nWorth noting that this is the stage which references the Lestas \"Anti noobs protection\"!\n\nStage 4\nWe have the final module! This module now needs to have all generic deobfuscation tricks applied to get decompilation.\nEnd Result\nThe end result of this effort is going from a file that fails to decompile:\n\nTo:\n\nClearly some functions still fail to decompile, but it may be enough to just read the instructions at this point to understand the intent.\nAnd code objects that go from this:\n\nTo this:\nClosing Thoughts\nThere's one common theme in this post that I hope some readers picked up on: we are constantly battling the decompiler's ability to unravel code based off of heuristics instead of battling the obfuscator injecting garbage. The const predicates for example aren't even that big of a deal -- they just insert false control flow that at a source level is fairly straightforward to see is garbage.\nHowever, this false control flow is enough to throw off the decompiler's ability to figure out a single source code pattern that results in the entire code object failing to decompile. This isn't a jab at uncompyle either -- it's a great tool that works fairly well considering there's zero competition in this space. However, I think that if I were to solve this problem from scratch in 2023 I'd solve it very differently by working on a better decompiler that erodes away mapping of 1:1 source code to bytecode, and instead focuses on rebuilding source with the same functional semantics.\nAs reverse engineers we don't really care about how the code was originally written, we just want to understand its intent at a higher level.\nThanks\nThank you, reader, for making it this far.
